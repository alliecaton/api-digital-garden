# Digital Garden API

This is the backend API for my digital garden.

This API uses Nodejs ESM, Express, Prisma (originally Sequelize, but migrated to Prisma for better ESM support), and a PostgreSQL database.

You can read more about the creation of this website, the plan, and inspiration [in my first post](https://garden.alliecaton.com/posts/3).
